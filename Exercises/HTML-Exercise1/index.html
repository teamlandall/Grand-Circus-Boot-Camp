      <p>Mase, you know ain't nothing change but my limp
        Can't stop till I see my name on a blimp</p>

    <h3> According to Puff Daddy </h3>
      <p> For you to shine here, deal with many women
        But treat dimes fair, and I'm
        Bigger than the city lights down in Times Square
        Yeah, yeah yeah</p>

    <h3> According to Notorious B.I.G. </h3>
      <p>Playboy, I told ya, being mice to me
