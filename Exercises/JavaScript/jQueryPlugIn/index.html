          <h2> This Love is Hot But It's Cold </h2>
              <h3>In The Style Of Taylor Swift</h3>

                <p id="firstP">We were both fluffy when I first saw you.
                You fly a kit and the flashback starts:
                Quebec is where I'm standing in the one minute ago air.</p>

                <p>What are you doing with that new lover?
                Who wears that fast sock,
                When I wear a slow the other sock,
                Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
                That what you're looking for is my awkward fingers.</p>

                <p>So this is me running, 
                Standing in front of you saying, "Let's bump uglies"
                And I go back to one minute ago all the time.
                It turns out freedom ain't nothing but jumping lovingly,
                Wishing I'd realised You have poop on your shoe.
                I'd go back to one minute ago, turn around and do some sledding.
                I go back to one minute ago quite often.</p>

                <p>Darling, let's do some slidding,
                This love is foggy but it's clear.
                It's a love story, darling,
                Just be my coordinated lion.</p>

                <p>We are never ever ever going to try singing swimmingly together,
                We are never ever ever going to try singing swimmingly together,
                You go talk to your first cousin second removed, talk to my mom, talk to me,
                But we are never ever ever ever going to try singing swimmingly together,
                Just munching harshly forever.</p>

                <p>Lookin' good darling, Lookin' good.</p>
