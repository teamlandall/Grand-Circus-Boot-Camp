			"She never hit the brakes and she was shifting gears",
			"Love struck Romeo, sings the streets of serenade",
			"Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you",
			"It's 3am and she hands me my raincoat",
			"They say this drinking will kill me",
			"I got 99 problems but a nodeJS server is more than likely one",
			"Mayonaise color Benz I call my Miracle Whip"]
